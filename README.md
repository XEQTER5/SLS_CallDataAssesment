# SLS_CallDataAssesment

Hello, 

Hope you are having a nice day.

The main file call data_assessment.csv could not be uploaded to the git. Please make sure you have the file on your local.
Before you try and read the file, please make sure the change the path to pd.read_csv for all, while importing the data which is main file and while importing the external data file. 

All the file required for tableau are attached in the git except one which is derieved from main file. The code for all file generation is present in the notebook.

I have attached the complete .twb file for my dashboards. I have attached a reference for the the connections are supposed to be made as well. Please refer to the Tableau_Connections.pdf

Please do let me know if you need additional information from my side.

Thank you, 
Gourav Joshi
